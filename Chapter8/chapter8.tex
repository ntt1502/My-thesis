\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter8}
Routing protocol designing is classical problem in network communication. With the wireless sensor network, especially the wireless sensor network with harsh condition, the routing protocol designing becomes more difficult due to the existence of routing holes. Although a lot of protocols have been proposed, none of them targets and solves the near hole routing problem. In this thesis, we have thorough studied the routing in wireless sensor network with holes problem. Our research proposed a novel algorithm that targets and solves the near hole routing problem. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we proved that our proposed ensures both two main requirements of a routing protocol: energy consumption and load balancing. As future work, we will extend our protocol for the multiple holes problem, support the network model with multiples sinks or propose an adaptive protocol for the dynamic routing hole.
