  abstract = {Void areas (holes) as an inevitable phenomenon exist in geographic routing of wireless sensor networks, because the unpredictable and harsh nature application environment or uneven energy consumption. Most of the existing schemes for the issue tend to construct a static detour path to bypass a hole. The static detour path may lead to uneven energy consumption of the nodes on the perimeter of the hole; thus it may enlarge the hole. At the same time, traffic would concentrate on the peripheral node of the hole; thus the nodes on the perimeter of the hole tend to be depleted quickly. In previous work, we have proposed a hole geometric model to reduce the energy consumption and packet collisions of the nodes on the hole boundary. This scheme, however, still has the static detour path problem. Therefore, we extend the previous work by constructing a dynamic detour path hole geometric model for wireless sensor networks in this paper. The location of hole detour anchor is dynamically shifted according to Gaussian function, just generating dynamic hole detour paths.},
